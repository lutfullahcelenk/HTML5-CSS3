            <h1>WE NEED YOUR HELP!</h1>
            <p>Your monthly sponsorship donation to help a child in Africa actually benefits the child's entire family.

                Children receive nutritious food, medical services, educational tutoring, clean water, extracurricular
                activities, and service opportunities.
                Adolescents receive vocational training in carpentry, tailoring, crocheting, etc., so they can help the
                family and prepare for their future.
                Parents can participate in adult literacy classes as well as quarterly classes on topics addressing
                hygiene, parenting, and sanitation. They also have access to income-generation training.
                Join with us today. Donate to help children in Africa. You can make a lasting difference!</p>

                <p>Your donations matter to young eager scholars and their communities. You can make a world of
                    difference.
                    One way you can help is by sponsoring a child’s education through monthly giving.You can be the
                    person
                    who opens the door to education for a deserving student in need.Another way is by donating to help
                    cover
                    the cost of shipping the books and school supplies. Every week we receive several boxes of supplies
                    and
                    we need help on an on-going basis with covering the shipping costs. A single drum costs over $200 to
                    ship
                    to Africa. Every dollar donated gets us one step closer to getting these supplies into children's
                    hands.</p>

                <h3>Medical</h3>
                <p>Health care in Sub-Saharan Africa remains the worst in the world, with few countries able to spend
                    the $34
                    to $40 a year per person that the World Health Organization considers the minimum for basic health
                    care.
                    And despite widespread poverty, an astonishing 50 percent of the region’s health expenditure is
                    financed
                    by out-of-pocket payments from individuals.Donor attention has yielded remarkable efforts to fight
                    HIV/AIDS,
                    tuberculosis, and malaria. But most of the region lacks the infrastructure to deliver health care
                    and faces
                    a severe shortage of trained medical personnel. As Africa's economies improve, the demand for good
                    quality
                    health care will only increase further.
